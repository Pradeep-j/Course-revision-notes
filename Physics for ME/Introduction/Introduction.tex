\section{Introduction}
This document is a compilation of the notes that were taken while I prepared for the ME46006, Physics for Mechanical Engineers course exam. It was written with the intention to revise as I was copying over some notes in the hopes that I would review some of the material while typing this out. The organisation of the document is simple, it starts with the necessary review of necessary mathematical prerequisites. These are mainly from the excellent resource that is \href{https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html}{Feynman's lectures on Physics, Volume 2}. In fact, much of the course material is covered in volume 2 and it can be used as an additional reference, as I have done. The remaining part of this document covers my summaries of the lectures in order, example problems and homework problems that were assigned.
